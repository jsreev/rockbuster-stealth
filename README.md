# Rockbuster Stealth Project

## Project Context

Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. Facing stiff competition from major streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the Rockbuster management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service to stay competitive and relevant in todayâ€™s market.

## Key Questions

- Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
- What is the average rental duration for all movies?
- In which countries are Rockbuster customers based?
- Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
- Do sales figures differ between geographic regions?

## Data

The Rockbuster dataset was created by CareerFoundry for this project. The dataset was analyzed using PostgreSQL and includes information on customers, staff, store locations, movies in stock, actors, movie languages, and rentals.
